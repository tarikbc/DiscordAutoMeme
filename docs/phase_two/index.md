# Phase Two: Authentication and Account Management

## Overview

Phase Two builds upon the foundation established in Phase One by implementing a comprehensive authentication system, role-based access control, and robust account management features. This phase focuses on user experience and security, ensuring that users can safely register, log in, and manage their Discord accounts.

  - [ ] GET `/api/dashboard/content` (content delivery statistics)
- [ ] Implement data aggregation services
- [ ] Add caching for dashboard data
- [ ] Create filters for dashboard data

### 7. First-Time Setup Experience (Estimated time: 2 days)

- [ ] Create API endpoints for guided setup:
  - [ ] GET `/api/setup/status` (setup completion status)
  - [ ] POST `/api/setup/account` (add first Discord account)
  - [ ] POST `/api/setup/complete` (mark setup as complete)
- [ ] Add setup progress tracking
- [ ] Create validation for setup steps
- [ ] Implement setup status in user model

### 8. Testing and Security Audit (Estimated time: 3-4 days)

- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for authentication
- [ ] Implement security testing suite
- [ ] Perform penetration testing on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Verify token encryption
- [ ] Test role-based access control
- [ ] Audit API endpoint security
- [ ] Document security findings and mitigations

## API Endpoints to Implement

### Authentication Endpoints

```
POST /api/auth/register
  Request: { email, password }
  Response: { user, token }

POST /api/auth/login
  Request: { email, password }
  Response: { user, token }

POST /api/auth/logout
  Request: { token }
  Response: { success }

POST /api/auth/refresh
  Request: { refreshToken }
  Response: { token, refreshToken }

POST /api/auth/forgot-password
  Request: { email }
  Response: { success }

POST /api/auth/reset-password
  Request: { token, newPassword }
  Response: { success }
```

### User Management Endpoints (Admin)

```
GET /api/users
  Response: { users: [...], total, page, limit }

GET /api/users/:id
  Response: { user }

PUT /api/users/:id
  Request: { role, ... }
  Response: { user }

DELETE /api/users/:id
  Response: { success }
```

### Account Management Endpoints

```
GET /api/accounts
  Response: { accounts: [...], total, page, limit }

POST /api/accounts
  Request: { name, token, settings }
  Response: { account }

GET /api/accounts/:id
  Response: { account }

PUT /api/accounts/:id
  Request: { name, token, settings }
  Response: { account }

DELETE /api/accounts/:id
  Response: { success }

POST /api/accounts/:id/start
  Response: { status }

POST /api/accounts/:id/stop
  Response: { status }

GET /api/accounts/:id/status
  Response: { status, uptime, friendCount, ... }

GET /api/accounts/:id/status/history
  Response: { history: [...] }
```

### Setup Endpoints

```
GET /api/setup/status
  Response: { completed, steps: [...] }

POST /api/setup/account

```

## Key Technical Challenges

1. **Secure Password Handling**: Implementing proper password hashing, storage, and verification.

2. **JWT Management**: Creating secure JWT tokens with proper expiration and refresh mechanisms.

3. **Discord Token Security**: Encrypting and securely storing Discord tokens to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Role-Based Access**: Implementing flexible yet secure role-based access control.

5. **Real-time Status Monitoring**: Creating an efficient system for monitoring multiple Discord clients in real-time.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase Two, we will have:

- A secure authentication system with email/password login
- Role-based access control for regular and admin users
- Comprehensive account management API
- Secure storage for Discord tokens
- Real-time status monitoring for Discord clients
- First-time setup experience for new users
- Dashboard data endpoints for frontend development

## Transition to Phase Three

Phase Three will build upon this authentication and account management foundation by implementing the frontend client. The API endpoints created in Phase Two will be consumed by the React frontend, providing a complete user experience.

## Estimated Timeline

Phase Two is expected to take approximately **18-25 developer days** to complete, with a strong focus on security and user experience.

## Resources Required

- Node.js developer with security expertise
- Experience with JWT and Passport.js
- Knowledge of encryption best practices
- Understanding of MongoDB for user data storage
- Experience with API design and testing
